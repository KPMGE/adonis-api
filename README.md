# adonis api
This is a simple api made with [adonis](https://adonisjs.com/).


## How to run it? :running:
The easiest way to run this api is by using [docker](https://www.docker.com/).
If you've already installed it, running this api is as simple as running the
following command on the project's root directory:

```bash
sudo docker-compose up
```

This command will build a docker image for this api as well as initializing a
mysql database for you. It will run the api migrations once the container starts
too, so don't worry about it.

After a little while, everything should be up and running. The api will be
running by default on the port 3333. Now you can start playing with it! :rocket:
